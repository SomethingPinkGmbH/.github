Welcome! We're a bootstrapped company founded by a married couple after spending almost two decades each in various IT roles. Apart from making games, we also still participate in open source projects and create new ones.

In our past professional lives, we created, managed, and contributed to several well-known open source projects. Something Pink is our new avenue of adventure and creativity.

### Games

Our [games](https://store.steampowered.com/developer/somethingpink) cover different genres and usually scratch a niche itch.

### Broomrocket

[Broomrocket](https://github.com/broomrocket) is a slowly evolving suite of ?-to-3D tools with a long-term mission and vision: **Broom goes vroom!**

### Community

You can engage with us on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/developer/somethingpink) as well as directly on GitHub by participating in [discussions](https://github.com/orgs/somethingpinkgmbh/discussions) or opening an issue in the relevant repository.
