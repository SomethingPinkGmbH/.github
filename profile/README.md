Welcome! We're a bootstrapped company founded by a married couple after spending almost two decades each in various IT roles. Apart from making games, we also still participate in open source projects and create new ones.

In our past professional lives, we created, managed, and contributed to several well-known open source projects. Something Pink is our new avenue of adventure and creativity.
